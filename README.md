I've become a bit rusty with some programming languages and git skills. My plan is to use this account for 
personal skill development, particularly as I deepen my modern C++ skills and work on applications as a hobbyist. 
My hope is to make a significant career change in the near future. I have math, software development, metrology 
and mechanical design backgrounds and am especially interested in geometry algorithms and visualization.
